# Blood bandages
Summary of findings from [research paper published on blood bandage](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/vox.13018) 

## Question
How can we attract more men to donate blood? One possibility is based on the idea that behaviours could advertise underlying traits. So we conudcted a test to see what traits are associated with donating blood. People saw one of three versions of the person who wore either (1) no bandage, (2) a plain bandage, or (3) a blood donation branded bandage. 

## Method
Survey respondents viewed one of three images and rated the person on various dimensions

## Conclusion
- Wearing a subtly marked bandage more effectively communicates that you donated blood than wearing than routinely applied bandages.
- Campaigns such as [this](https://www.donateblood.com.au/true-colours) could be effective
