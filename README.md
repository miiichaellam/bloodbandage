# Blood bandages
Summary of findings from [research paper published on blood bandage](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/vox.13018) 

## Goal/Purpose
How can we attract more men to donate blood? One possibility is based on the idea that behaviours could advertise underlying traits. In this context, donating blood could be a signal of the donor's generosity. 

### Method
We conducted a test asking people online to rate their perception of a person. Survey respondents saw one of three versions of the person who wore either (1) no bandage, (2) a plain bandage, or (3) a blood bandage.

## Conclusion
- Wearing a subtly marked bandage more effectively communicates that you donated blood than wearing the routinely applied bandages.
- Campaigns such as [this](https://www.donateblood.com.au/true-colours) could be effective
